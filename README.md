# **ADUtilities**

A growing collection of tools, scripts, and resources designed to support **Active Directory (AD) pentesting**, troubleshooting, and environment assessments.
This repository aims to provide practical, ready-to-use utilities that help streamline common tasks encountered during AD security engagements.

## **Current Tools**

### 🔧 **TimeFix – AD Clock Skew Sync Script**

A lightweight Bash script that fetches the time from a target Windows host (via WinRM HTTP headers) and synchronizes your Linux machine’s clock.
Useful for resolving **Kerberos clock-skew errors (KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW)** during pentesting.

## **Roadmap**

More tools will be added soon, including:

* AD enumeration helpers
* Credential & ticket utilities
* Automation shortcuts for common AD operations
* Misc. red-team friendly scripts

Stay tuned — this repo will grow into a handy toolkit for anyone working with AD security.
